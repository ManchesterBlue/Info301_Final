## Introduction
This project examines the interplay between global COVID-19 infection trends, government policies, and public sentiment on social media. By integrating epidemiological data, policy measures, and large-scale Twitter analysis, we assess how public discourse and engagement evolved throughout different phases of the pandemic. Our study explores key factors influencing tweet volumes and sentiment, highlighting the complex interaction between policy responses, public reactions, and the shifting dynamics of pandemic progression across regions. Through a multi-dimensional approach, this research provides insights into the relationship between crisis communication, government interventions, and public sentiment trends during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Research Questions

1. **COVID-19 Spread and Evolution**  
   - How did COVID-19 infection trends fluctuate across different regions and time periods?  
   - What patterns emerged in confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over the course of the pandemic?  

2. **Government Policy Impact**  
   - How did various government interventions (e.g., lockdowns, travel restrictions, vaccination campaigns) influence infection rates?  
   - Did stricter policies lead to noticeable shifts in public sentiment and social media engagement?  

3. **Public Sentiment and Social Media Trends**  
   - How did COVID-19-related Twitter activity change over time and across geographical regions?  
   - What were the dominant emotions and topics discussed, and how did they align with major pandemic events and policy changes?

## Dataset
This project integrates multiple datasets to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on global public discourse and government responses:

- [**GeoCov19 Twitter Dataset**](https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/covid19): A large collection of geotagged and location-metadata tweets related to COVID-19.
- [**OpenICPSR COVID-19 Sentiment and Topic Dataset**](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/120321/version/V12/view): A dataset containing sentiment classification and topic modeling of COVID-19-related tweets.
- [**Our World in Data COVID-19 Statistics**](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases): Aggregated COVID-19 case numbers, hospitalizations, recoveries, and government policy responses.
- [**COVID-19 Global Case and Policy Dataset**](https://covid19datahub.io/): This dataset compiles country-level data on confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, hospitalizations, and vaccinations.

By integrating these diverse datasets, our study captures the intersection of epidemiological trends, government interventions, and public sentiment. This approach enables a deeper understanding of how policy measures shaped public discourse and how social media activity reflected pandemic developments. The analysis also helps assess whether social media trends can serve as early indicators of public health concerns, providing valuable insights for crisis management and policy adaptation.

## Analysis Tools

- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression and **XGBoost** for trend prediction and sentiment analysis.
- **SHAP Analysis**: To quantify the influence of different factors on tweet volumes and infection rates.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Visualization of global tweet distribution using **GeoPandas** and **Plotly**.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Exploring weekly/monthly variations in tweet activity and case trends.

---

## Results

### 1. Temporal Dynamics and SHAP Analysis
- **Weekend Effect**: Higher social media engagement during weekends.
- **Policy Shifts and Public Sentiment**: Stricter lockdowns correlated with spikes in negative sentiment and higher tweet volumes.

### 2. Geospatial Trends in Social Media Activity
- **Countries with High Tweet Volume**: USA, China, India, UK, Brazil.
- **Regions with Low Engagement**: Parts of Africa and Central Asia showed minimal COVID-19-related social media discussions.

### 3. Relationship Between Public Sentiment and Government Policies
- **Strict Government Policies â†’ Increased Public Frustration**: Higher stringency scores aligned with spikes in tweets expressing negative sentiment.
- **Vaccine Rollouts â†’ Positive Sentiment Spikes**: Public optimism increased in regions with successful vaccine distributions.

---

## Conclusion
This study highlights how public sentiment and online discussions evolved alongside COVID-19 case trends and policy interventions. By leveraging **SHAP analysis**, we identified key temporal and geographical drivers of pandemic-related social media activity. The results suggest that **public engagement with COVID-19 discussions was heavily influenced by weekends, policy shifts, and regional differences in government responses**.

Future work can expand on this by integrating **real-time social media monitoring**, further refining sentiment analysis techniques, and exploring additional contextual factors influencing public discourse.
